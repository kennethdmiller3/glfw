@section main_intro Introduction

GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for opening a window,
creating an OpenGL context and managing input.  It is easy to integrate into
existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.

[Quick introduction](@ref quick) is a short tutorial for people new to GLFW.

[Moving from GLFW 2 to 3](@ref moving) explains what has changed and how to
update existing code to use the GLFW 3 API.
